title: Temperature Sensor
description: Temperature sensors are extremely common sensors used for automations such as heating, cooling, and ventilation. Most are battery powered and use low-power wireless protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, or bluetooth to reduce battery consumption. Most also include a humidity sensors as well. Some also come with screens for quick viewing of the current temperature and humidity, although this naturally decreases battery life.

  - name: Xiaomi Mijia LYWSD03MMC
    description: Comes with a screen as well. By default these sensors are bluetooth and can be used with an [esphome bluetooth proxy](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html), but the chip also includes a zigbee radio. Some recent development has led to an easily flashed [zigbee firmware](https://smarthomescene.com/guides/convert-xiaomi-lywsd03mmc-from-bluetooth-to-zigbee/) for these sensors that is compatible with both Z2M and ZHA(NOTE There's a zigbee firmware by devbis and pvvx - the pvvx version has much better battery life).
